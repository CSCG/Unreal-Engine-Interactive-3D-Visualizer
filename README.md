# MIDI-to-OSC
Here are some resources so you can get started with controlling events and effects inside of Unreal Engine 5.4 and above via a MIDI to OSC workflow. This is achieved through some MaxForLive devices as used in the Ableton Live Suite.

If you happen to have any ideas on how to improve the project, please feel free to contribute!
