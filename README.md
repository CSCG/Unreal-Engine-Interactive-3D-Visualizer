# MIDI-to-OSC
Here are some resources so you can get started with controlling events and effects inside of Unreal Engine 5.4 and above via a MIDI to OSC workflow. This is achieved through some MaxForLive devices following a MIDI to OSC protocol, as used in the Ableton Live Suite.

If you happen to have any ideas on how to improve the project, please feel free to contribute!

The Unreal Engine blueprints and MaxForLive devices are built off of the work as found on the "Sem and Tris AV Club" as well as their own respective YouTube channels. So be sure to check out their channels for even further information on the basics regarding the blueprints. Thanks for allowing me to modify the project, as well as for allowing me to make the modified version open source.
